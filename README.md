INTERMAGNET has recommended that a timing accuracy of at least 10 ms is required when producing 1-second data (Love, 2004). In order to meet this requirement, observatories need to be able to check the timing accuracy of their datalogger chain.

Here, we present a simple Arduino­-based magnetic signal generator that can be used as a timestamping tester. We will provide both the source code and build instructions, so that observatories around the world could easily make their own timestamping tester and evaluate time delays of their own systems.
